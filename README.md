# SeqExportUI
Tal.py is the file for batch export using streampix.
currently fits for OperatingRoom4. (change CAM_DIR according to OR)
GUI folder is for running the UI. the .json files are updated while using the Ui and saving inputs (orange button)
later i will connect the 2 components (the UI and the batch exporter)
