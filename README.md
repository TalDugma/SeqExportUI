# SeqExportUI

Tal.py is the file for batch export using streampix.
currently fits for OperatingRoom4. (change CAM_DIR according to OR- where the .seq outputs are being saved)
File expects to be ran as:
python Tal.py <.seq file path> <output folder path> and has the same export settings as in the streampix GUI. (on the lunchbox & room4)


GUI folder is for running the UI. the .json files are updated while using the Ui and saving inputs (orange button)

later i will connect the 2 components (the UI and the batch exporter)
